# As New Vinyl Repairs
## A new business Website

## Synopsis     

This system is going to be coded using HTML5, Bootstrap 
and CSS3.  I am going to keep it as simple as possible
to maintain speed and ease of maintenance.  I am not
going to tie it to any frameworks at the moment.  KISS
until we see a need to add complexity.  This is a fairly
standard but pretty business/services rendeed type of
site.  RESPONSIVE and FLUID.  I may tie it to a CMS
of mine in the future.  Or I can just spend a few moments
a few times a year and do small mods myself as requested.
A HUGE CMS is overkill.
