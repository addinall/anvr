// System       : New Website for ANVR (aka Don Nero aka Clifton Donnelly!)
// Date         : September  2016
// Author       : Mark Addinall
// Synopsis     : This system is going to be coded using HTML5, Bootstrap 
//                and CSS3.  I am going to keep it as simple as possible
//                to maintain speed and ease of maintenance.  I am not
//                going to tie it to any frameworks at the moment.  KISS
//                until we see a need to add complexity.  This is a fairly
//                standard but pretty business/services rendeed type of
//                site.  RESPONSIVE and FLUID.  I may tie it to a CMS
//                of mine in the future.  Or I can just spend a few moments
//                a few times a year and do small mods myself as requested.
//                A HUGE CMS is overkill.
//		          Index.  The landing page.  Carousel and some CSS3 animations/transitions
//		          to make it pretty.
//
//                The HTML code has been written as pretty discrete "chunks"
//                or modules.  That way Clifton and I can swap panels and
//                sections in and out of the site with ease.
